Solutions for [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) (In Progress)

Each year I try to learn a new programming language or a new aspect of a programming language I already know. This year, I'm trying to learn more about Streams, which was added in to the language since Java 8. It's been a few years since I've worked with Java, so this should be a great resource to help learn more about what's new.

Solutions are presented in Java, built using Maven.

# Solutions
The solution for each day is in its own class under `/src/main/java/com/jacoblucas/adventofcode2018`. Each respective day has its own main method to run the solution for that day. 

The solutions for parts 1 and 2 for the day will be printed to stdout.
