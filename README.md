Solutions for Advent of Code 2018 (In Progress)
https://adventofcode.com/2018

Each year I try to learn a new programming language or a new aspect of a programming language I already know. This year, I'm trying to learn more about Streams, which was added in to the language since Java 8. It's been a few years since I've worked with Java, so this should be a great resource to help learn more about what's new.

Solutions are presented in Java, built using Maven.
